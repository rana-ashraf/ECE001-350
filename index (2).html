<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>An Operating system (OS) is a software which acts as an interface between the end user and computer hardware.</p>
<p>Every computer must have at least one OS to run other programs.</p>
<p>An application like Chrome, MS Word, Games, etc needs some environment in which it will run and perform its task.</p>
<p>The OS helps you to communicate with the computer without knowing how to speak the computer's language.</p>
<p> It is not possible for the user to use any computer or mobile device without having an operating system.</p> 
<p>Without an operating system, a computer is useless.</p>
