<h3>Memory Management</h3>
<p>Memory Management is the process of controlling and coordinating computer memory, assigning portions
known as blocks to various running programs to optimize the overall performance of the system.</p>
<h3>Memory Addresses & Description</h3>
<h4>1. Symbolic addresses</h4>
<p>The addresses used in a source code. The variable names, constants, and instruction
labels are the basic elements of the symbolic address space.</p>
<h4>2. Relative addresses</h4>
<p>At the time of compilation, a compiler converts symbolic addresses into relative addresses.</p>
<h4>3. Physical addresses</h4>
<p>The loader generates these addresses at the time when a program is loaded into main memory.</p>
