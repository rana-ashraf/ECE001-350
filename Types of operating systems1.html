<h3>Types of Operating System</h3>
<p>An Operating System performs all the basic tasks like managing file,process, and memory.</p>
<p>Thus operating system acts as manager of all the resources,operating system becomes an interface between user and machine.</p>
<h5>Types of Operating Systems: Some of the mostly used operating systems are as following:</h5>

<th>Advantages</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1. Batch Operating System:</td>
<td>It runs on a server and provides the server the capability to control data, users, groups, security, applications and other networking functions.</td>
<td><li>No mechanism to prioritise the processes.</li>
<li>No interaction between user and computer.</li>
<li>Multiple users can share the batch systems</li>
<li>The idle time for batch system is very less</li>
<li>It is easy to manage large work repeatedly in batch systems</li></td>
</tr>
<td>2. Multiprocessor Systems</td>
<td>A Multiprocessor system consists of several processors that share a common physical memory.
In multiprocessor system all processors operate under single operating system.
Multiplicity of the processors and how they do act together are transparent to the others.</td>
<td><li>Enhanced performance</li>
<li>Execution of several tasks by different processors concurrently, increases the system's throughput without speeding up the execution of a single task.</li>
<li>system divides task into many subtasks and then these subtasks can be executed in parallel in different processors.</li></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Distributed operating System</td>
<td>These types of operating system is a recent advancement in the world of computer
technology and are being widely accepted all-over the world and, that too, with a
great pace. Various autonomous interconnected computers communicate each other
using a shared communication network. Independent systems possess their
own memory unit and CPU.</td>
<td><li>Electronic mail increases the data exchange speed</li>
<li>Less load on the Host Machine.</li>
<li>Fast processing.</li>
<li>ser at one site can utilize the resources of systems at other sites for resource-intensive tasks.</li></td>
